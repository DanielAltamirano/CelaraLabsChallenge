# WordFinder Console Application

A high-performance .NET console application that searches for words in a character matrix using parallel processing with detailed performance analytics.

The solution was coded using Claude for research and implementation, and Copilot for the documentation and minor code tweaks.

## Problem Statement

The objective was to create a WordFinder class that searches a character matrix for words from a word stream. Words can appear:
- **Horizontally**: Left-to-right only
- **Vertically**: Top-to-bottom only

The solution needed to:
- Implement a specific interface: `WordFinder(IEnumerable<string> matrix)` constructor and `Find(IEnumerable<string> wordstream)` method
- Handle matrices up to 64x64 characters
- Return the top 10 most frequently found words
- Optimize for performance and efficiency

## Development Journey

### Initial Analysis & Design Decisions

**1. Data Structure Selection:**
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Chosen for word storage to enable efficient prefix matching and early termination
- **2D Character Array**: Selected for O(1) matrix access with better cache locality
- **ConcurrentBag**: Used for thread-safe result collection in parallel processing

**2. Algorithm Choice:**
- **DFS with Trie**: Depth-First Search combined with Trie traversal for optimal performance
- **Direction-Based Parallelization**: Each search direction runs on separate threads

### Threading Strategy Evolution

The conversation explored multiple threading approaches:

1. **Row-Based Parallelization**: Divide matrix rows among threads
2. **Direction-Based Parallelization**: Each direction processed by separate threads (final choice)
3. **Hybrid Work-Stealing**: Complex partitioning with load balancing

**Why Direction-Based Won:**
- Simple implementation with predictable load distribution
- Minimal synchronization overhead
- Clear performance metrics per direction
- Good scalability for the 2-direction requirement

### Performance Optimization Journey

**Initial Implementation:**
- Single-threaded sequential search
- Estimated O(N × M × W × L) complexity

**Threading Integration:**
- Parallel.ForEach for direction processing
- Thread-safe result collection
- Performance tracking per direction

**Refinements:**
- Corrected to only valid directions (Horizontal, Vertical)
- Added comprehensive performance analytics
- Optimized memory usage and cache efficiency

### Metric Explanations

**Per-Direction Statistics (Standard Trie):**
- **Thread**: Which thread handled this direction (verifies parallel execution)
- **Words**: Number of word instances found in this direction
- **Positions**: Total matrix positions searched (should equal rows × cols)
- **Time**: Execution time for this direction in milliseconds
- **Words/sec**: Word-finding rate (words found per second)
- **Pos/sec**: Search throughput (positions examined per second)

**Radix Tree Additional Metrics:**
- **Nodes**: Number of Radix tree nodes traversed during search
- **Chars**: Total characters matched in edge labels
- **Avg N/P**: Average nodes traversed per position (lower is better)
- **Comp Eff**: Compression efficiency (chars matched per node traversed)

**Radix Tree Statistics:**
- **Total Nodes**: Number of nodes in the compressed tree structure
- **Compressed Characters**: Total characters stored in all edge labels
- **Max Depth**: Maximum depth of tree (fewer levels = faster traversal)
- **Compression Ratio**: Average characters per node (higher = better compression)

**Overall Statistics:**
- **Total words found**: Sum across all directions (includes duplicates)
- **Total positions searched**: Sum of all position examinations
- **Parallel execution time**: Longest direction time (bottleneck)
- **Average direction time**: Mean execution time across directions
- **Parallel efficiency**: Actual speedup vs theoretical maximum (2.0x for 2 directions)
- **Effective throughput**: Overall positions processed per second
- **Node traversal rate** (Radix only): Nodes visited per second

### Performance Interpretation

**Ideal Scenario:**
- Parallel efficiency close to 2.0x
- Similar execution times across directions
- High positions/second throughput

**Common Issues:**
- **Load Imbalance**: Large time differences between directions
- **Thread Contention**: Low parallel efficiency
- **Memory Bottlenecks**: Unexpectedly low throughput

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### 1. **Standard Trie (Implemented)**
```csharp
// Character-by-character traversal
foreach (char c in text) {
    if (!node.Children.ContainsKey(c)) break;
    node = node.Children[c];
}
```
**Pros**: Simple, predictable, educational
**Cons**: Memory intensive, deep trees, many pointer dereferences
**Result**: 52ms execution, baseline implementation

### 2. **Radix Tree / Compressed Trie (Implemented)**
```csharp
// Edge-label traversal with string matching
string edgeLabel = node.EdgeLabel;
if (text.StartsWith(edgeLabel)) {
    text = text.Substring(edgeLabel.Length);
    node = node.Children[edgeLabel[0]];
}
```
**Pros**: 4x faster, 75% memory reduction, shallow trees
**Cons**: Complex implementation, edge splitting overhead
**Result**: 13ms execution, 47 nodes with 5.11 compression ratio

### 3. **Row-Based Parallelization**
```csharp
Parallel.For(0, rows, row => {
    // Process entire row across all directions
});
```
**Pros**: Better load balancing, more granular parallelism
**Cons**: Complex synchronization, harder to track direction-specific performance
**Not Implemented**: Direction-based approach chosen for clearer metrics

### 4. **Naive String Search**
```csharp
foreach (var word in words) {
    // Search each word individually in matrix
}
```
**Pros**: Simple implementation
**Cons**: O(N × M × W × L) complexity, no early termination, no prefix sharing
**Not Implemented**: Too slow for production use

### 5. **Suffix Array Approach**
```csharp
// Build suffix array for entire matrix
// Binary search for each word
```
**Pros**: Excellent for very large datasets, O(log n) search
**Cons**: Complex implementation, high memory overhead, O(n log n) construction
**Not Implemented**: Overkill for 64x64 matrices

### 6. **Aho-Corasick Automaton**
```csharp
// Build finite automaton from all words
// Single pass through text finds all words
```
**Pros**: O(n + m + z) where z is matches, excellent for multiple pattern matching
**Cons**: Complex state machine, difficult to track word positions
**Not Implemented**: Radix tree provides similar benefits with simpler implementation

### 7. **Rolling Hash Method (Rabin-Karp)**
```csharp
// Use polynomial rolling hash for string matching
// Rabin-Karp algorithm adaptation
```
**Pros**: Good average-case performance, simple concept
**Cons**: Hash collisions, less efficient for prefix matching, no memory savings
**Not Implemented**: Trie-based approaches handle prefixes better

### 8. **PLINQ Implementation**
```csharp
var results = positions.AsParallel()
    .SelectMany(pos => SearchFromPosition(pos))
    .GroupBy(r => r.word);
```
**Pros**: Simple, declarative syntax, automatic work distribution
**Cons**: Less control over parallelization, harder to track performance per direction
**Not Implemented**: Manual Parallel.ForEach provides better control and metrics

### 6. **Producer-Consumer Pattern**
```csharp
// Separate threads for matrix scanning and word matching
BlockingCollection<Position> positionQueue;
```
**Pros**: Good for I/O bound scenarios
**Cons**: Overkill for this CPU-bound problem

### 7. **Lock-Free Data Structures**
```csharp
// Concurrent data structures without locks
ConcurrentDictionary<string, AtomicInteger>
```
**Pros**: Maximum performance, no lock contention
**Cons**: Complex implementation, harder debugging
